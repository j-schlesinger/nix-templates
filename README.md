# Project Nix Templates
A collection of Nix flakes to create shells/dev environments.
## Develop Templates
Language-specific templates upon which project templates are built.
These contain everything that I want to use for the given language:
- Language environment manager
- Build tools
- LSPs & common configurations
- Commonly-used libraries (if applicable)
- Any bells and whistles I'm never without

## Shell Templates
Templates for shells that aren't specifically development environments, but used in workflows.

## Other Flakes
Any flake that does something a little weirder than creating a shell or dev environment.

## Warranty
This software is provided as-is with no guarantees of safety or accuracy.

Use at your own risk.
Review any open source software before running it yourself.
Wear sunscreen, that one's not related to software, it just protects you from ionizing radiation.
